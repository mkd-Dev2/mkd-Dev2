### Backend
-   *(Details to be added upon backend implementation/specification)*: The `Backend/` directory suggests a separate server-side application. Common choices might include Node.js (Express), Python (Django/Flask), Go, etc.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

-   `Backend/`: Contains all server-side code and API logic.
-   `Frontend/`: Contains the React application, including UI components, assets, and styling.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
-   npm or Yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/syfers-portfolio.git
    cd syfers-portfolio
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Frontend directory and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd Frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the Backend directory and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../Backend
    npm install # or yarn install (if Node.js backend)
    # Or follow specific backend setup instructions
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd Backend
    npm start # Or specific backend command (e.g., node server.js, python app.py)
    ```
    *(Ensure your backend is running before starting the frontend if they communicate.)*

2.  **Start the Frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    cd ../Frontend
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```

    The frontend application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port as indicated by Vite).
